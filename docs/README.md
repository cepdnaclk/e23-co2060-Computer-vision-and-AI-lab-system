## Introduction

This project implements a comprehensive web platform for the Computer Vision and AI Lab, designed to streamline both public outreach and internal operations. The public interface acts as a dynamic portfolio, showcasing the lab's latest research, publications, and team achievements to the academic community.

Internally, the system features a secure management dashboard to digitize daily workflows. Key modules include an inventory booking engine for high-value equipment (such as drones and cameras) and a scheduling system for shared GPU computing resources. By replacing manual logbooks with role-based automation, this platform ensures efficient resource utilization and seamless collaboration between students and administration.
